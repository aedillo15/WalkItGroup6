Introduction
The idea for our app is a token collecting game.  While the app is open, the location of the device will be displaying a real time map showing the user's location.  There will be tokens laid out on the map, and the user can collect these tokens by travelling in real life with their device towards the location of a token.  
Since our application is a game/entertainment app, our target audience could be anyone who is trying to be entertained, or even get out more, as our app will encourage users to physically leave their houses to visit new locations to collect new tokens. Despite the pandemic times we are in now, this game can give an incentive to our users to  become active and be competitive against other users as they chase tokens to climb the leaderboard.
The main functionality that will be implemented is a live map tracking the usersâ€™ location which determines if the user has an important location or a landmark that offers tokens (parks, monuments, malls, recreation centres, schools). With this functionality within our  application, our application can solve our users' lack of daily physical activity or any stay-home tendencies.
Work Distribution
The work distribution has not been precisely distributed as we are unsure of the exact steps needed to build the app, as well as how much work would be involved in each of these steps. With more research and planning the work distributions can change at any time during the development process. A tentative distribution of the work would be something like:
Ethan Reinke: Creating the live updating working map (Main Functionality)
Arzen Edillo: Responsible for the different page layouts and the navigation between them (UI/UX)
Syed Bilal Amir: Responsible for the use, maintenance, and updating of data. (Database Design)
We will figure out the more we research and plan, who will be doing what, and our final submission will include explicitly labeling by whom each portion of the app was written by.
